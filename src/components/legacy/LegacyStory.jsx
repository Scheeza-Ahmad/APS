              The story of Ali Public School is not just about buildings or books; it is a story of grit and determination.
              Our founder grew up in a household where education was a distant dream. His father, a hardworking man,
              could not read or write. He saw the struggles of a life without education firsthand.
            </p>
            <p className="font-body text-gray-600 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              But he had a vision. He promised himself that he would not only educate himself but would one day
              make quality education accessible to every child in his community, regardless of their background.
